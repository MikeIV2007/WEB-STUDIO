## HTML Techniques
- Document Structure:

    - DOCTYPE Declaration: Ensures the document is rendered in standards mode.

     - Meta Tags: Specifies character encoding, viewport settings, and compatibility mode.

- Semantic Elements:

    - Use of semantic tags like <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, and <footer> to define the document structure clearly and   enhance accessibility.

- Navigation and Links:

    - Site Navigation: A <nav> element contains the main navigation links.
    - Link Elements: Proper use of anchor tags (<a>) with clear href attributes for navigation.

- Form Elements:

  -   Modal Form: Includes input elements for user interaction, such as text, email, and phone inputs, and a textarea for comments.
    - Form Labels and Inputs: Use of <label> for associating text with input elements, improving accessibility.
    - Icons and SVGs:

- SVG Icons: Using <svg> and <use> elements to include scalable vector graphics, which are resolution-independent and versatile.

## CSS Techniques
- External Stylesheets:

    - Linking external CSS files to maintain a clean separation between content (HTML) and presentation (CSS).

- Normalize.css:

    - Use of modern-normalize.min.css to ensure consistent styling across different browsers by normalizing default styles.

- Custom Fonts:

    - Integration of custom fonts from Google Fonts using the @font-face rule to enhance typography.

- Flexbox Layout:

    - Implementing flexbox for layout control, particularly for the navigation menu and social media links, to create responsive and flexible layouts.

- CSS Variables:

    - Use of CSS variables for consistent styling and easy theming across the project.

- Responsive Design:

    - Media queries to ensure the website is mobile-friendly and adjusts layouts based on different screen sizes.

- Transitions and Animations:

    - CSS transitions to add smooth animations for interactive elements like buttons and menu toggles.
